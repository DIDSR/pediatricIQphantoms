`Issue Tracker <https://github.com/DIDSR/pediatricIQphantoms/issues>`_ | `Source Code <https://github.com/DIDSR/pediatricIQphantoms>`_ | 

One of the best ways to contribute is by improving our documentation. This project uses `sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/tutorial/narrative-documentation.html>`_ as a documentor with the `Matlab Domain extension <https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/matlabdomain>`_. More resources on documentation can be found at `writethedocs.org <https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/>`_.

docstrings
----------

The easiest and most effective way to start contributing to the user manual and documentation of the project is by helping improve our `docstrings <https://sphinx-doc.org/en/master/tutorial/automatic-doc-generation.html>`_ docstrings, the comments just below the function signature. See some of the `currently documented functions for examples <https://github.com/DIDSR/pediatricIQphantoms/blob/cdd34a1772a191aff5a10db0a60459cd8b91fd47/src/pediatricIQphantoms/make_phantoms.py#L294>`_.
